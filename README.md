# heatmap-generator-using-esp32-and-amg8833
A first step in transoforming energy management in buildings ⚡

## 🤷 What is this project about?
This project uses ESP32, ST7789 TFT Display, and AMG8833 Thermal Sensor to generate heatmap based on temperature detection of two-dimentional area: 8x8 (64 pixels). It can be run by Arduino IDE.

## ⭐ What's coming?
Heat-map generatopr using ESP32 and AMG8833 sensor is a first step to our project in using these heatmaps to recommend optimized configurations for ACMV system and light fittings as the heatmaps represent the activity level of spaces with the people. Our next step involves an extensive collection of heatmaps data to be used in an AI recommendaton model. Stay tuned!🔥
