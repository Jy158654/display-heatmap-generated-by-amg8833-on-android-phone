A first step in transforming energy management in buildings ‚ö°

## üü† What is this project about?
‚Ä¢ This project uses **ESP32**, and **AMG8833 Thermal Sensor** to generate heatmap based on temperature detection of two-dimentional area: 8x8 (64 pixels). The heatmaps are displayed on Android phones. We tried our app on **Android 13** and it has no problem working.

## AMG8833's connections with ESP32
‚Ä¢ Vin 3V3  
‚Ä¢ GND GND  
‚Ä¢ SCL SCL  
‚Ä¢ SDA SDA  

## Required libraries for AMG8833
‚Ä¢ Adafruit_AMG88xx (download from Arduino IDE)

## ‚≠ê What's coming next?
‚Ä¢ Generating heatmaps using ESP32 and AMG8833 sensor is a first step to our project in using these heatmaps to recommend optimized configurations for ACMV system and light fittings as the heatmaps represent the activity level of spaces with the people.  
  
‚Ä¢ Our next step involves an extensive collection of heatmaps data to be used in an AI recommendaton model.  
Stay tuned!üî•
